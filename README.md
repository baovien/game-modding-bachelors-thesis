# Designing for Extensibility: Allowing third party modifications in modern video games

## Abstract
This thesis investigates what measures developers take to allow third party modifications in modern
video games. Much of the success of many of the most popular games today is directly connected to
modding. Video game modding, a word originating from modification, is the act of adding changes
to a video game as a third-party developer.

The thesis investigates how the four popular games DotA 2, Minecraft, Cities: Skylines and World
of Warcraft are modded and what measures the developers have taken to allow for it. The games
were chosen for analysis due to their different approaches to modding. In addition to this, the
thesis documents common practices of modding from both a game developer’s and a third-party
developer’s standpoint.

An experiment to put the information gathered into practice was conducted by creating a game and
adding mod support for it. The thesis documents this process and finds that adding mod support
to a game alongside development can be a task without significant effects on the workload.

The games investigated use methods like creating public APIs, allowing for code injection, creating
sandbox environments, implementing server side data authentication and creating modding tools
to allow for modding. Minecraft, despite being a game with many popular mods, does not support
modding, showing that mod communities can arise within games regardless of mod support.

The thesis suggests that mod support seems to be an inexpensive addition to a game compared to
its potential benefits if decided upon predevelopment.
